			<h2>The 100 Best, Most Interesting Blogs and Websites of 2015</h2>
			<p>Every year I release a list of the best, most interesting blogs and websites I have encountered in the previous 365 days that I think other people should know about in the coming 365 days. I’ve done this for 3 years straight—this will be the 4th. As in years past this post was literally 1 year in the making (although it took a mere 2 days to organize and assemble). Real quick: go behind the scenes of DailyTekk on Instagram (@DailyTekk is brand new with totally exclusive pics and videos).

So far this year DailyTekk has rounded up and ranked the 100+ best Instagrammers, the 100 best YouTubers, the 100 best Pinners and the 100 best Vine accounts of 2015</p>
<p>How do I choose which sites make the cut? To be sure, website and blog owners tweet and email me suggestions year round (as do impartial third parties): but the funny thing is, with few exceptions, I only include sites I come across myself organically—making this list a sort of extension of myself. I look for sites that are well designed, unique in some way and, plainly put, addicting. There’s nothing scientific about these lists: they’re merely full of sites I think are interesting or cool for some reason. Yes, many of these sites have been around for more than a year—it’s just that I really discovered them and took an interest in them this year. See my picks from previous years: 2012 | 2013 | 2014</p>
